## ðŸ–¥ Developing locally

1. Run `yarn` (or `npm install`)
2. Set up [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens), refer to [Authenticating with GraphQL](https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/forming-calls/#authenticating-with-graphql) for requisite scope
3. Run `GITHUB_TOKEN=<WHATEVER_GITHUB_GENERATED_FOR_YOU> yarn develop` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN=<WHATEVER_GITHUB_GENERATED_FOR_YOU> npm start`)
4. Alternatively, you may create an `.env` file in your project root, and put `GITHUB_TOKEN=<WHATEVER_GITHUB_GENERATED_FOR_YOU>` inside. Then, you may run `npm start` directly. The `.env` file will be `.gitignore`d so you won't commit your `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
