### ü•Ø Flow v0.106 [Coming Soon: Changes to Object Spreads](https://medium.com/flow-type/coming-soon-changes-to-object-spreads-73204aef84e1)

- the current model is based on an assumption that inexact object types do not specify own-ness, this makes properties from spread become optional because object spread at run time copies only _own_ properties
- the new model assumes inexact object types specify own-ness on specified properties, therefore following our intuition of object spread more closely
- inexact objects _may_ contain more properties that may overwrite existing properties in spread target
- the new model will err, tell us what happens, and ask if we can make the spreaded object exact
